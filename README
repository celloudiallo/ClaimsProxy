The ClaimsProxy library enables you to get a WIF cookie collection for a SharePoint site which is protected by Claims Based Authentication. It assumes that ADFS is configured as the Trusted Identity Token Issuer and that the down-stream identity provider is based on the StarterSTS / IdentityServer project.

This repository includes both the ClaimsProxy library and a sample application.

Todo:

- Add support for multiple WIF cookies (FedAuthN etc)
- Implement tracing to replace the DebugEvent delegate

Any application utilising the library should implement some caching of the SharePoint cookie for the duration of it's lifetime against the requesting username to reduce authentication round-trips.
